      you a couple questions.

    text: What... Henry's dead? That can't be, I mean, we just saw him yesterday...
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: I know this is hard for you to hear, but I'd like to know what kind of
      relationship you had with him.
  - speaker: 'Emma '
    text: We were fine, we never argued with him, yesterday we sat at his place and
      drank wine, after that I left, I had to study for an exam at university.
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: Have you noticed anything suspicious lately
  - speaker: 'Emma '
    text: No, everything's been normal, although I remember a couple days ago Henry
      was out with his brother, they even got into a fight, I tried to ask him for
      details but he wouldn't tell me.
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: Thanks for your help, if I have any more questions I'll get back to you.

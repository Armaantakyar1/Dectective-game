    text: Good afternoon, I'm Detective Harvey, I'm investigating Henry's murder,
      I found this note in his hotel room, did you leave it?
  - speaker: 'Alice '
    text: Henry is dead? How? But we did...
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: How did you know Henry?
  - speaker: 'Alice '
    text: Yes, I was in the same mafia with him, I loved him and I wanted us to go
      to another city together and start a new life. I'm leaving for Ocean City in
      a couple hours, I was hoping we'd meet up today and he'd come with me.
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: Did you know he's in a relationship with Emma?
  - speaker: 'Alice '
    text: Yes, I saw Henry occasionally, Emma was jealous of him and so they fought
      a lot, I was hoping he would leave her and come to me.
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: Thanks, I found out everything I needed to know.

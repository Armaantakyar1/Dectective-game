  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: I found out that Henry was hit on the head, causing him to fall on the
      corner of the table by the deceased. He also had a lady in his room with whom
      he was probably fighting
  - speaker: 'Captain Ross '
    text: Lady you say? I'll try to find out who it could have been.
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: Does he have any relatives?
  - speaker: 'Captain Ross '
    text: I'll try to find out, come by my office tomorrow. By the way Harvey, I
      found this bracelet in Henry's hand, it has the initials H+E on it, do you
      know anything about it?
  - speaker: 'Harvey '
    text: No, it is the first time I've ever seen that bracelet, but I think it's
      a good lead.
  - speaker: Captain Ross
    text: Okay, don't forget to come by my office tomorrow.
